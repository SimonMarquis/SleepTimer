1. Add the Tile in the Quick Settings panel.
2. Tap the Tile to start a timer.
3. Extend, reduce or cancel the timer with the notification actions.

When the timer reaches zero, the music volume slowly fades away and any app playing music is paused.

<u>Note:</u> Don't look for a launcher icon, this app only provides a Quick Settings Tile.
